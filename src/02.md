## Shorthand with some commands

Let's make a simple repo. We'd usually do that with

	$ mkdir simple
	$ cd simple
	$ git init
	Initialized empty Git repository in ...

We can do that with 2 commands instead of 3 with

	$ git init simple
	Initialized empty Git repository in ...
	$ cd simple

## Shorthand with some commands

Let's add and commit some files.

	$ touch {a,b,c}.txt
	$ git add {a,b,c}.txt
	$ git commit -m 'start'
	[master (root-commit) 6c3f5b3] start
	 3 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
	 create mode 100644 a.txt
	 create mode 100644 b.txt
	 create mode 100644 c.txt

Let's make a new branch and switch to it. We'd usually do that with

	$ git branch test
	$ git checkout test
	Switched to branch 'test'

We can do that in one with

	$ git checkout -b test
	Switched to a new branch 'test'
