| what           | why                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `git`          | to clone this repo                 |
| `node` + `npm` | so we can generate .html from .md  |
| a browser      | so that you can look at the slides |
| GNU `make`     | so we can use % pattern rules      |
| POSIX          | so that make can run sh            |
